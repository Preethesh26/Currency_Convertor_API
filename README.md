# 🌍💱 **Currency Converter Using Fetch API** 💱🌍

## 🎯 **Project Purpose**  
This project was created to enhance my understanding of the **Fetch API** in JavaScript and to demonstrate how to build a functional web application that interacts with real-time data. It's a hands-on example of how APIs work and how to fetch, process, and display live exchange rates for currency conversion. Through this project, I also learned how to handle asynchronous operations, manage errors, and deliver a seamless user experience.
